    <p class="aiml blue e1">I mean there are ways to add sentences with one click to Anki. The Migaku Browser Extension (fitting to the addon you already have) lets you add them with basically one click (like this). But in this case they are not completely random, as they are still from your reading/listening material.Never heard of something that does it completely random as that would be kinda bad if you end up with a ton of sentences you don't understand or that contain multiple words you don't knowNever heard of something that does it completely random as that would be kinda bad if you end up with a ton of sentences you don't understand or that contain multiple words you don't knowNever heard of something that does it completely random as that would be kinda bad if you end up with a ton of sentences you don't understand or that contain multiple words you don't know.</p>
