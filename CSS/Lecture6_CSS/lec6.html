    <h1 align="center"><i><b><u>Curious Cat</u></b></i></h1>
    <p align="center">The curious cat wandered silently across the ancient garden, where colorful butterflies fluttered gracefully, while distant laughter echoed, and the scent of blooming roses carried memories of forgotten summer afternoons into eternity.Although the morning began with the usual calmness of chirping birds outside my window and the faint golden rays of sunlight spilling softly across the wooden floor, I could not help but feel a peculiar mixture of excitement and nervousness as I prepared myself for a day that promised opportunities, challenges, and surprises, because the agenda involved not only presenting my ideas before a small yet attentive audience of colleagues who had been waiting patiently for me to share my progress, but also meeting an old friend after several years of separation, which in itself stirred a whirlpool of emotions—memories of carefree laughter, endless conversations, and quiet support during difficult times—making me wonder how much had changed, how much had remained the same, and whether our bond, once so natural, would easily rekindle; meanwhile, as I brewed a strong cup of coffee, its aroma filling the air with warmth and energy, I reminded myself that the only way to embrace such a demanding day was to step forward with confidence, trust in my preparation, and allow both the professional and personal moments to unfold naturally, like chapters in a story I had been waiting so long to revisit.</p>
